Amo viaggiare e vorrei farlo molto di più per poter incontrare e conoscere persone che vivono in modo molto di verso da me. Per queste ragioni ho pensato di diventare host, per riassaporare le piacevoli sensazioni della scoperta e del far scoprire.

Quindi non solo la splendida Piazza San Marco, ma anche la cucina, il vino, la musica, la terraferma e la laguna.......e che ne dite di sciare a Cortina e dormire in centro storico? Si può fare!",
