Standing in the iconic beating heart of ‘La Serenissima’ - St. Mark’s Square - where, at night, the orchestras of the world-famous Gran Caffe Quadri and Caffe Florian conjure up a truly magical atmosphere (music is dependent on weather and season!), while the pink and white marble of the Doge’s Palace glows, and the mosaics of the Basilica shimmer in the darkness.   A short stroll to the recently restored Rialto Bridge crossing the Grand Canal, and T Fondaco Dei Tedeschi - Venice’s new lifestyle department store.  Also within easy reach of 2 well-stocked supermarkets for all your self-catering requirements - one at Salizada San Lio and the other at Rialto - and to the vaporetto (water bus) stops at San Zaccaria and Vallaresso for simple and convenient travel around town.",

Il mercato del sestiere ebbe la sua prima collocazione proprio in calle del Paradiso, dove si ha testimonianza che fin dalla fine del primo secolo del 1000 numerose erano le botteghe ed i magazzini; un piccolo nucleo che poi diventerà agli inizi del 1200 il  mercato della città.

Sono travature in legno utilizzate per sorreggere le strutture aggettanti degli edifici con lo scopo di guadagnare spazio – permettevano di allargare solo i piani superiori delle case - senza invadere le strette calli veneziane.

Graduated in Natural Sciences I am a tourist guide leading people through the Venetian lagoon, a very wide ecosystem.  I like traveling whenever I can and knowing new people and other cultures is my must. That's why I decided to be a (Website hidden by Airbnb) is a way to travel without moving. I learnt English and French in two specific and curious ways. My English comes from another real passion, the American Football, for which I have been playing since 20 years.  I improved my french doing voluntarism in Africa, so becoming a France-Afrique speaking. I would be very happy to show you the city and its surroundings, making you living the Venetian experience and tasting the differences from the other cities in the world.

Sono laureato in Scienze naturali e per molti anni ho lavorato nel turismo come guida naturalistica facendo scoprire alle persone la mia amata terra e in particolare la laguna di Venezia. Amo viaggiare e vorrei farlo molto di più per poter incontrare e conoscere persone che vivono in modo molto di verso da me. Per queste ragioni ho pensato di diventare host, per riassaporare le piacevoli sensazioni della scoperta e del far scoprire. Insomma viaggiare rimanendo fermi! Ho giocato a football americano per vent'anni con cui ho imparato l'inglese che conosco, ho fatto molto volontariato sia in Italia che in Africa dove ho affinato il mio francese....ora divenuto france-afrique! Sarò lieto anche di mostrarvi la città e i suoi dintorni vivendola come la vive un veneziano, assaporandone le enormi differenze e contraddizioni che la rendono unica. Quindi non solo la splendida Piazza San Marco, ma anche la cucina, il vino, la musica, la terraferma e la laguna.......e che ne dite di sciare a Cortina e dormire in centro storico? Si può fare!",
